# IMPORTANT

- Never try to fix linter errors and warnings yourself, most of the time they are autofixable, so just leave them and let me do it, you don't even need to mention them.
  - Don't fix these: unexpected console statement, input order, unocss class order, indentation, etc
- The terminal is Windows CMD, so linux commands are not available.
- No need to care about backwards compatibility whatsoever, no one uses the app, we change what we want. It's more important to create the best implementation, instead of worrying about breaking changes
- Do not run scripts. Maybe suggest them, but I will take care of running them
- Do not create migrations, it is handled by scripts
- When adding new stuff, make sure to add them in a scalable way, so that it is easy to extend in the future
- When adding new stuff, make sure to follow existing patterns, unless you are explicitly told to improve them
